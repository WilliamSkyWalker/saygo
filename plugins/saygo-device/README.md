# saygo-device

Visual control for Android/iOS, browser pages and desktop windows. An external programming agent decides each step; Saygo provides shared CLI/MCP sessions, observations, actions, human handoff and durable task records. No LLM API key or test suite is required.

## Install for Claude Code or Codex

Install the published PyPI package (Python 3.10+, pipx and the selected client CLI must already be available):

```bash
pipx install 'saygo-agent-control[mcp]'
saygo setup --client both
# Or --client claude / --client codex
```

PyPI setup reuses its installed Python environment and registers a native `saygo-device@saygo-managed` plugin using each client's plugin CLI. The plugin includes the shared skill and an MCP server with an absolute interpreter path. It works from ordinary project directories without `SAYGO_HOME`, `PYTHONPATH`, manual MCP configuration, or a prompt asking the agent to read a file. Nothing is downloaded during MCP startup.

Start a new client session after installation and say: **“Use Saygo to inspect my connected devices, then help me operate a test application.”** The agent discovers sessions, connects the requested target and follows the bundled observation/action protocol. Claude installation adds Saygo-specific tool allow rules by default. Qoder/QoderCN installation includes the MCP entry, shared Skill and service trust. Codex uses the plugin-specific approval policy described in the distribution guide.

MCP does not support Playwright. Browser tasks use the extension backend; saved Playwright sessions are listed separately as unavailable through MCP. Use `--install-browser` only to add Playwright/Chromium for separate CLI work, or `--mobile` to add mobile Python dependencies. Android/iOS toolchains, application login and OS input permissions remain platform setup requirements. Native Windows/macOS installation is not yet live-verified; WSL installation and both clients' plugin ingestion are tested. No model API key is required by Saygo.

For source development, run `python3 scripts/install_development.py` from a checkout. Versioned GitHub release installers are another option and verify their source archives; the PyPI route bundles the installer and needs no repository clone.

Managed files live under `~/.local/share/saygo/agent-plugin`. Run `pipx upgrade saygo-agent-control`, then restart your Agent client to load the new package. Older copied-runtime installations need one setup migration after upgrading to a release containing this fix. Existing runtimes are retained for running clients; session/task data stays under `~/.saygo`. `--prepare-only` prepares files without registering clients. `--root PATH` selects another managed installation directory.

Do not enable an older `saygo-device@saygo-plugins` installation or a manually configured Saygo MCP server alongside the managed plugin: use one integration per client to avoid duplicate tools. The installer does not remove unrelated or existing client configurations.

The older Claude marketplace installation still exists for manually managed Python environments:

```text
/plugin marketplace add WilliamSkyWalker/saygo
/plugin install saygo-device@saygo-plugins
```

That route alone does not provision Python dependencies. Prefer the managed installer for the complete setup.

## Operate

Use the bundled [device skill](skills/device/SKILL.md) for the common protocol. Start by explicitly connecting a named session and querying its capabilities. Observe the image, decide one action, and inspect its result. Saygo handles percent/image/crop coordinate conversion; a dispatched action is not a verified business result.

MCP exposes `device_sessions`, `device_connect`, `device_observe`, `device_act`, `device_command`, `device_handoff`, `device_resume`, and `agent_task`. Compatible `device_screenshot`, `device_tap`, `device_swipe`, `device_input`, `device_type_send`, `device_key` and `device_launch` names remain available. Their `serial` argument refers to a saved session across all platforms.

For cross-resource work, create an interactive task. It owns its resources until completion/cancellation and saves action intents before input. Request IDs prevent replay after lost responses. Recover after an agent restart; reconcile `needs_review` using observed evidence. Manual login uses handoff/resume. Task timeline and evidence export keep execution facts separate from agent notes.

The CLI offers the same protocol through `saygo device` and `saygo task`. For other MCP clients, launch `saygo-mcp --profile device`. Autonomous QA remains available separately through `saygo run` with its own model configuration.
