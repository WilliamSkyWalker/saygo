# External agent operation

Saygo shares persistent sessions between CLI and MCP for supported backends. Playwright is CLI-only: MCP rejects Playwright connections, observations, actions and task execution, and lists these bindings under `unavailable_sessions`. MCP browser connections default to the extension backend. The device profile needs no model API key. New input commands do not implicitly create Android sessions if a binding is missing or expired.

## Install from PyPI

The published package is [saygo-agent-control](https://pypi.org/project/saygo-agent-control/). With Python 3.10+, pipx and your Agent CLI installed, run:

```sh
pipx install 'saygo-agent-control[mcp]'
saygo setup --client codex
# Or: saygo setup --client claude / both / qoder / qodercn / all
```

No repository clone or manual MCP configuration is needed. `saygo setup` uses the installer, Skill and browser extension bundled with the installed package, reuses the installed package environment, and registers your client integration. Follow its instructions to load the Chrome/Edge extension, click **Connect local bridge**, then restart the AI client. See [plugin installation](../plugins/saygo-device/README.md) for platform prerequisites.

To upgrade, run `pipx upgrade saygo-agent-control`, then restart the Agent client. MCP follows the same package environment; older copied-runtime installations need one setup migration using a release containing this fix. Use `saygo setup --help` for mobile dependencies, browser choice, update and uninstall options.

For source development, use `python3 scripts/install_development.py` from a checkout. For direct Python API work, install the package in your own virtual environment. The `browser` extra and Playwright are only for separate CLI browser automation; the browser-extension MCP setup needs the `mcp` extra and no Playwright installation. Other extras include `mobile`, `selenium`, `windows`, `mac`, and `qa`. Mobile device toolchains and desktop permissions remain separate setup steps.

An MCP client can start `saygo-mcp --profile device` using the environment's executable path. Prefer `saygo setup` for supported clients so it configures the runtime and paths together.

## Sessions and observations

```bash
saygo device connect --platform browser --backend extension --bridge-directory /path/to/bridge --session mail
saygo device connect --platform android --device DEVICE_ID --session phone
saygo device connect --platform windows --app 'Test Admin' --session admin
saygo device capabilities --session mail
saygo doctor --session mail
saygo device screenshot --session mail
saygo device act '{"type":"tap","x":50,"y":40,"coordinate_space":"percent"}' \
  --session mail --observation-id OBSERVATION_ID --observe-after
```

`device_act` takes the same action object. `device_observe`, `device_act` with a resulting observation, and task observe/submit/recover/resume return MCP image content; legacy `device_screenshot` returns metadata and a local path. Screenshots include a unique ID, timestamp, session, target, image dimensions, screen dimensions and image-to-screen mapping. `image` and `crop` coordinate spaces require a source observation ID. Crops are image-pixel `[left,top,right,bottom]` rectangles, magnified 2× with an explicit mapping back to screen coordinates.

Actions use `tap`, `swipe`, `input`, `press_key`, `open_url`, `open_app`, `scroll_up`, `scroll_down` and backend-dependent `double_click`, `right_click`, `hover`, `hotkey`, `long_press`, `scroll_at`. Query capabilities. `swipe` implements a drag on pointer backends. `hotkey` uses `keys: ["ctrl","a"]`; `long_press` uses seconds in `duration`; `scroll_at` uses `x`, `y`, and signed `amount` in wheel notches (positive up). Unsupported actions return errors.

For visual list navigation, target the intended pane and start with half its visible
height. Preserve overlap, reduce to 10–20% near a target, and stop when it is visible.
Compare a landmark in fresh screenshots after every scroll to adjust the next amount.
No movement calls for checking the pane, loading state and boundary before retrying.
Browser capabilities declare 100 CSS pixels per unit and allow fractions; other
backends can use native steps. Observations carry screen dimensions and capabilities.
The desktop model receives the previous scroll screenshot alongside the current one;
the model chooses each amount rather than an automatic retry loop.

`saygo device wait --session mail --mode stable --timeout 5` waits for stability; `--mode change` waits for change. A timeout returns `condition_met: false, timed_out: true`. Screenshot calls remain subject to the backend's own I/O timeout. A stable frame is not business success. Action results expose `business_success: null` and require external verification.

Visual revalidation compares decoded pixel changes, permitting small changes such as a distant caret; it additionally checks a small region around each pointer target. Changes to that region, page identity, URL or dimensions require re-observation. Desktop observations also include window ID, process ID and window bounds; supported desktop adapters recheck these before input and reject a changed target. Native foreground adapters check the foreground target too. These checks cannot prevent unrelated programs or people from changing focus during input. Pixel comparison is a heuristic, not proof that the business target is unchanged. All visual observations expire for action submission after 30 seconds.

## Interactive cross-device tasks

Bind project aliases once (stored in `.saygo/resources.json`):

```bash
saygo resources bind phone phone
saygo resources bind mail mail
saygo resources bind admin admin
saygo task create
# Or: saygo task create '{"phone":"phone","mail":"mail","admin":"admin"}'
saygo task observe TASK_ID --resource phone
saygo task submit TASK_ID --resource phone --request-id register-focus \
  --observation-id OBSERVATION_ID \
  --action '{"type":"tap","x_pct":50,"y_pct":40}' --note 'Focus the registration form'
saygo task observe TASK_ID --resource mail
saygo task handoff TASK_ID --instructions 'Please sign into the test mailbox'
saygo task resume TASK_ID --note 'User returned control after login'
saygo task recover TASK_ID
saygo task timeline TASK_ID
saygo task events TASK_ID
saygo task finish TASK_ID --note 'Verified the activation and admin result'
saygo task export TASK_ID --out evidence.zip
```

MCP `agent_task(command, task_id, options)` exposes these operations. `create` accepts `options.bindings`; `submit` accepts `resource`, `action`, `observation_id`, `request_id` and optional `note`. Persist the returned task ID in the agent's own context. Status and execution events live in Runtime's SQLite store, defaulting to `$SAYGO_HOME_DIR/runtime` (`~/.saygo/runtime`). `SAYGO_RUNTIME_DIR` overrides the task store; all clients must use the same value. Session state and global operation locks use `$SAYGO_HOME_DIR` regardless of working directory.

Dispatch intent is committed before input. Lost responses never cause automatic replay: an accepted request ID cannot dispatch twice. Interrupted dispatch becomes `needs_review`; `resolve --outcome completed|not_executed --note ...` reconciles it. Both outcomes invalidate old observations. Submitting a new action is an explicit decision. An `idle` task with an error rejected its action before dispatch; inspect the event history. A failed screenshot after acknowledged input is recorded separately in the action's `evidence.error`, without marking the input uncertain or replaying it.

Task handoff blocks its bound sessions. Resume obtains fresh screenshots and leaves business verification to the agent. Individual session handoff works across mobile, browser and desktop too. Tasks and workflows retain global resource ownership through idle, handoff and uncertain-result states. Ordinary device commands and other tasks cannot use those resources until `finish` or explicit `cancel --note ...`; use the owning task interface. `saygo task list` locates unfinished tasks. OS locks also serialize in-flight operations across entrances and across all local desktop windows. These locks protect Saygo operations, not unrelated programs or a human using the host.

All device operations write local JSONL facts under `$SAYGO_HOME_DIR/operations`; mutating commands capture before/after images when available. Page creation, selection and closing also record the selected page and page list; closing the selected page records screenshot unavailability without selecting another page. Interactive tasks and planned workflows share durable before/after evidence: `action_dispatching.before` records the source observation, and `action_evidence` records the resulting observation or capture error, including after a dispatch exception. Agent notes are separate `agent_annotation` events. Export includes state, execution facts and captured screenshots; it may contain application data, input text and messages from the task.

## Validation status

| Path | Validation in this change |
|---|---|
| CLI/MCP session sharing, mapping, handoff, uncertain dispatch | Offline contract tests |
| Cross-resource task recovery and request deduplication | Offline tests with simulated devices |
| Browser / Playwright | CLI/Runtime only; MCP rejects this backend. Local Chromium two-page task, subprocess recovery and handoff tested |
| Installed wheel outside checkout | Clean Python 3.12 virtual environment without system site packages; `browser,mcp` extras, CLI/doctor/MCP startup and live Chromium integration passed; no Appium, Selenium or OpenAI installed |
| Android / iOS physical devices | Existing adapters; new complete task path requires device validation |
| Windows via WSL PowerShell runner | Isolated live background fixture: input, reconnect, window ID/process/bounds rejection; foreground, cursor and clipboard preserved. Foreground integration not run |
| Native Windows desktop | Window identity checks implemented; native adapter requires host validation |
| macOS background desktop | Five live tests on macOS 12.7.6: isolated native panel button, Unicode input/delete, scroll, CLI reconnect and MCP stdio actions passed with frontmost PID, pointer and clipboard unchanged. Existing current-desktop windows only; arbitrary app workflows remain unverified. See [background limits](control.md#macos-background-mode) |
| Browser extension / Selenium | Existing adapter tests; advanced actions vary by backend |

The isolated installation run used Pillow 12.3.0, Playwright 1.63.0 and MCP 2.2.0 with an existing host Chromium binary. It verifies Python dependency isolation and operation outside the checkout, not browser/system dependency installation on a fresh operating system. The package is published on PyPI; the release pipeline checks wheel installation and plugin preparation on Linux, Windows and macOS.

The real phone registration → mailbox activation → desktop administration acceptance scenario is not certified by simulated tests. It requires designated test applications/accounts and a real-device run. `doctor` checks connection, capture and local image decoding; it reports input permission as untested unless you explicitly pass `--probe-action` with an action on a chosen harmless target; the resulting screenshot still requires visual verification. Platform support should remain experimental until the relevant real run is recorded.

## Diagnose and recover a resource

`device diagnose --session NAME` / MCP `device_command("diagnose", NAME)` returns
window identity, same-process candidates (including excluded helpers and overlays),
capture mode, capabilities, and recovery guidance. Capture failures include this
structured evidence when the controller is available. This is diagnostic evidence,
not proof of a business result or proof that every app window rejects capture.

For durable tasks, both the desktop model and external agents use `diagnose(resource)`
and `repair(resource, operation, note, window_id)` through `agent_task` (CLI:
`saygo task diagnose/repair`). `operation` is `reobserve` or `select_window`.
Window selection is validated against the current bound process and eligible visible
candidates. Repairs invalidate old screenshots, are journaled, and never replay input.
The next step must obtain a new observation. Pending uncertain input still requires
explicit reconciliation.

The desktop model receives observation errors and diagnostics even when no screenshot
can be captured. It chooses a recovery based on that evidence; unavailable images are
never replaced by old frames. It cannot act on an unobserved resource or report done
while observations are failing. Three consecutive observation failures or six diagnostic/
recovery decisions trigger a bounded handoff. Login and foreground authorization remain
human steps. No application names or song-specific recovery paths are encoded.

Outside tasks, `device_observe` and `device_act` accept an explicit `window_id` and
Windows `foreground` flag (CLI `--window-id`, `--foreground`). Foreground capture is
opt-in; it is not inferred from `background=false` and is not automatically enabled
after a background capture failure.
