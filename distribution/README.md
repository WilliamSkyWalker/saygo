# Saygo distribution

One versioned Python installer prepares an isolated MCP runtime, registers the native
Claude/Codex plugins, configures Qoder/QoderCN, and installs the Chrome/Edge native messaging host. Git is not
needed. Run it in the environment where the client CLI runs (including WSL).
Python 3.10+ and a supported Agent client are prerequisites. This is currently a
beta distribution. The Python package is published on PyPI; signed desktop installers
and Chrome Web Store publication are not part of this release.

## Install from PyPI

The standard client setup uses the published package, without cloning a repository:

```sh
pipx install 'saygo-agent-control[mcp]'
saygo setup --client codex
```

Use `--client claude`, `both`, `qoder`, `qodercn`, or `all` for other integrations.
After setup, load the browser extension from the path printed by the installer,
click **Connect local bridge**, and restart the Agent client. Update with
`pipx upgrade saygo-agent-control`, then restart your Agent client. PyPI setup binds MCP to
the same installed environment. Existing installations made before this change need a
one-time setup migration using a release that contains this fix.

## Install from GitHub release assets

With Python 3.10+ available, run one command in a writable directory to download and start the installer. No manual GitHub download is needed.

macOS / Linux / WSL:

```sh
curl -fL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WilliamSkyWalker/saygo/main/scripts/install_saygo.py -o install-saygo.py && python3 install-saygo.py
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WilliamSkyWalker/saygo/main/scripts/install_saygo.py -OutFile install-saygo.py -ErrorAction Stop; py -3 install-saygo.py
```

The fixed command selects the newest version on each run, including prereleases. Use `python3 install-saygo.py --channel stable` to exclude betas, or `--check` to show the newest version without installing. Installer options such as `--auto-update` are forwarded.

The installer auto-detects installed Claude, Codex, Qoder and QoderCN clients. Optional flags: `--client codex`,
`--client claude`, `--client qoder`, `--client qodercn`, `--client all`,
`--client both` (Claude + Codex), `--mobile`, `--browser edge`, or
`--browser none`. MCP browser control uses the extension, never Playwright.
`--install-browser` is an independent CLI-only Playwright option.

The release installer verifies the downloaded source ZIP against its embedded
SHA256 before extraction. For a locally downloaded archive:

```sh
python3 install-saygo-0.4.3.py --archive saygo-0.4.3.zip
```

Python dependencies are fetched from PyPI; this is not an offline bundle or a
fully locked dependency environment. WSL also downloads a checksum-pinned private
Windows Python for the browser host. It does not require Git or a user-managed
Python installation on Windows. Native Windows users run `py -3` instead of
`python3`. In WSL the extension files are copied onto the Windows filesystem.

Install [Saygo Browser from the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ehomcchjfomfkcmbeinlcmpbaamdhfbo).
The store ID is `ehomcchjfomfkcmbeinlcmpbaamdhfbo`; Developer mode is not required.
When switching an existing installation from the unpacked version, run
`saygo setup --extension-id ehomcchjfomfkcmbeinlcmpbaamdhfbo` (or pass the same
option to the release installer). This overrides the previously saved development
ID. Manually release the old extension before connecting the store extension,
and disable or remove the old copy in the browser. Open the store extension popup
and click **Connect local bridge**. All website tabs in that profile become accessible to Saygo.
Restart the Agent client. Ask it to list browser pages and connect a named session.
The bridge path is saved in `~/.saygo/browser-bridge.json` (or `SAYGO_HOME_DIR`), so
new MCP extension connections no longer require a manually supplied path.

## Update and uninstall

Starting with 0.4.6, managed installations check GitHub releases in the background
on every Agent MCP server startup, regardless of the previous check time. Checks do not delay startup.
New-version reminders appear in `device_sessions` results and client stderr logs.
The default is **notify only**, with the stable release channel.

To enable automatic updates, add these options to the installation command:

```sh
python3 install-saygo-0.4.3.py --auto-update --update-channel beta
```

`beta` includes prereleases (Saygo currently ships beta releases). Use `stable`
for non-prerelease versions only. Existing 0.4.0 users must run the 0.4.1 installer
once to obtain the update launcher.

After installation, manage updates without downloading another installer:

```sh
python3 "$HOME/.local/share/saygo/agent-plugin/update.py" --check
python3 "$HOME/.local/share/saygo/agent-plugin/update.py" --auto on --channel beta
python3 "$HOME/.local/share/saygo/agent-plugin/update.py" --apply
python3 "$HOME/.local/share/saygo/agent-plugin/update.py" --auto off
```

Windows PowerShell uses `py -3 "$HOME/.local/share/saygo/agent-plugin/update.py"`
with the same options. For a custom installation root, use its `update.py` and
append `--root PATH`. Package/checkout users can also use `saygo update` with these
options; it manages the selected **managed installation**, not a source checkout
or a global pip installation.

Automatic updates download and verify the installer and source SHA256 from the
GitHub release assets, then prepare and smoke-test a separate runtime. They switch
at a later MCP startup only when other managed MCP servers are closed and no
unfinished Runtime tasks exist. Existing processes keep their original runtime.
Offline checks, failed downloads and failed preparation retain the working version.
Old runtimes and `previous-runtime.json` are kept; there is no automatic cleanup.
A changed browser bridge, extension or client Skill requires the full installer
and any browser reload; the updater reports this instead of partially upgrading.

The versioned installer itself still installs its named version. The desktop GUI
and unmanaged installations are not automatically updated by this mechanism.

Close active Saygo tasks. Run the newer release installer using the same root,
let Chrome update the store extension after approval, then start a new Agent
session. For an explicitly selected development build, manually reload the unpacked
extension and reconnect it. Old runtimes are preserved for rollback; existing sessions are retained.
The extension and host negotiate protocol version before any actions are sent.
Protocol mismatch instructs the user to update both sides; it is not reported as
successful connection. Versions 0.3.x lack this handshake and need both updated.

```sh
python3 install-saygo-0.4.3.py --uninstall
```

Uninstall removes native client plugins and this installation's browser host
registration. It preserves runtimes, extension files and task records, including
screenshots. Remove the extension through Chrome/Edge. Marketplace definitions
remain reusable. Another installation's host registration is never deleted.
Use the same `--root` if a custom root was used for installation.

## Maintainer build and store upload

Browser extension versions come from `extensions/saygo-browser/manifest.json`
and are independent of the Python package version. Only change the extension
version when its files change. Build an extension-only upload with
`python3 scripts/build_release.py --extension-only --out dist/browser-store`.
The store item ID is `ehomcchjfomfkcmbeinlcmpbaamdhfbo`. Version 0.4.8 is public;
0.4.12 was submitted for review on 2026-10-03. Use the Chrome Web Store status
workflow for current status. Existing development installations switch through
the explicit setup command above.


```sh
python3 scripts/build_release.py --out dist/release
```

Outputs: hash-pinned installer, source ZIP, development extension ZIP, store upload
ZIP (without development key), SHA256SUMS and release metadata. Source bundling
uses a narrow allowlist; no user session state, credentials or device captures are
included. `--prepare-only --client both --root /tmp/saygo-package-check` builds
client bundles without registering clients/hosts. Running from the checkout is
available for Codex via `python3 scripts/install_development.py` (project scope only).

Push a tag matching `distribution/release.json` to run regression checks, publish
GitHub release artifacts and automatically submit the store ZIP for review. Google
publishes it after approval. The Python package workflow separately publishes to
PyPI after its checks. Manual Build release runs only produce artifacts.

The store ZIP excludes the development manifest key. Keep the store ID in
`release.json`; native host registration must match the installed extension.
Development builds remain available with an explicit development ID. See
[store setup and review status](STORE_LISTING.md) for credentials, listing fields
and the read-only status workflow.

## Verification boundary

Automated checks cover ZIP/hash integrity, native host IPC, protocol negotiation,
registration ownership and plugin configuration. The opt-in Chromium test covers
real extension/host operation in an isolated Linux browser profile. Production
Chrome/Edge store installation, macOS and fresh Windows machines need acceptance
runs; existing Windows/WSL driver testing does not prove this new distribution flow.

## Private configuration (.env)

The package never includes the developer's `.env`. External Agent device control
does not require an Saygo model API key or database. Optional QA/model settings
load in this order: defaults → `~/.saygo/config.env` → working-project `.env` →
process environment. `SAYGO_HOME_DIR` changes the user-config directory. Explicit
`SAYGO_CONFIG_FILE=/absolute/path/.env` replaces project-file discovery; a missing
explicit file is an error. Package installation paths are never searched for `.env`.

To keep an existing configuration without copying credentials:

```sh
python3 install-saygo-0.4.3.py --config-file /absolute/path/to/private.env
```

The managed plugin stores only `SAYGO_CONFIG_FILE` and preserves it on upgrades;
it never embeds the file's contents. Both clients then resolve the same file even
when launched from different directories. For a portable user configuration, use
`saygo init --user` to create a blank template at `~/.saygo/config.env`, or `saygo
init` for the working project's `.env`. Templates are created with owner-only
permissions on POSIX and never overwrite existing files. Keep secrets out of source
control. Database settings belonging to another application are not automatically
consumed by Saygo.

## Authorize continuous operation in Codex

Codex controls MCP tool approvals. Selecting **Always allow** on one tool does not
authorize all other Saygo tools. To authorize the managed Saygo plugin once, put
this service-scoped setting in the user's `~/.codex/config.toml`:

```toml
[plugins."saygo-device@saygo-managed".mcp_servers.saygo]
default_tools_approval_mode = "approve"
```

Merge into that table if it exists; do not create a duplicate TOML table. Start a
new Codex session after changing configuration. This applies to Saygo tools,
including actions that change connected applications, and does not change shell
sandboxing or other MCP services. Existing per-tool overrides and managed policies
can still take precedence. Restore `"prompt"` to require confirmation again.
For a directly configured MCP server instead of the managed plugin, use the
corresponding `[mcp_servers.saygo]` table. Starting with 0.4.4, selecting Codex in the installer adds this scoped approval
when no explicit server approval policy exists. Existing policies and per-tool
overrides are preserved. The installer respects `CODEX_HOME`, backs up existing
configuration to `config.toml.before-saygo`, and removes only its unchanged approval
entry on uninstall. `--prepare-only` does not change client configuration.

## Default Claude, Qoder and QoderCN setup

Selecting these clients automatically configures Saygo-only continuous operation;
there is no separate trust flag or per-tool setup step. Installation updates
existing settings without replacing unrelated entries and saves a private
`settings.json.before-saygo` backup. `--prepare-only` never changes client settings.

- Claude: after native plugin installation, add `mcp__plugin_saygo-device_saygo__*`
  and `mcp__saygo__*` to `permissions.allow` in the user settings. These cover the
  plugin and direct Saygo server naming conventions.
- Qoder: install the `saygo` MCP entry with `trust: true` in
  `~/.qoder/settings.json` and copy the shared operation Skill to
  `~/.qoder/skills/saygo-device/SKILL.md`.
- QoderCN: the same setup in `~/.qoder-cn`, selectable as `--client qodercn`.
  This is the QoderCN CLI configuration used by the tested local installation.

Qoder clients use the same isolated Python interpreter and device-only MCP profile
as Claude/Codex. An explicitly selected Qoder client can be configured before its
CLI is on PATH. Auto detection also recognizes existing user configuration and
private CLI installation directories. `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and `QODER_CONFIG_DIR`
are respected; the installer accepts `QODERCN_CONFIG_DIR` for a custom domestic
client directory (launch that client with its matching configuration directory).

Restart client sessions after installation. Managed deny/ask policies or higher
priority project settings may still require approval. Saygo authorization does
not change shell approval or authorize other MCP servers. Uninstall removes only
permissions it added and unchanged Saygo server/Skill entries that it owns;
user-customized entries are preserved. Native Qoder IDE configuration is not
claimed verified by the CLI integration.

## Development is project-local

Run `python3 scripts/install_development.py` in a Saygo checkout (`--mobile` adds mobile dependencies).
This provisions `.saygo-dev/`, writes only the checkout's `.codex/config.toml`, disables the user
Saygo plugin in that project, and installs a local device skill. The development entry point
refuses to start outside this checkout. Development sessions use `.saygo-dev/state`; user sessions
remain in `~/.saygo`. It never registers a native host or changes the store extension connection.
Other directories keep the user plugin and the installed release package.

`--source` may no longer install a development checkout into the global user plugin. The private
`--package-python` setup parameter validates a non-editable release package before registering it.
The normal user command is simply `saygo setup --client codex`; custom extension IDs are explicit overrides.

Codex project plugin scoping follows [the official project configuration documentation](https://developers.openai.com/plugins/build/plugins).
